Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

No bugs that we know of.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

checkerDT.c: line 83: low priority: 
This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

Yes the area is deeply nested, but this is much more readable than the
alternative of having multiple different loops to handle the different
index sizes possible.

your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1       BDT_insert  
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2       BDT_freeSubtree 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3       BDT_addChild
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4       BDT_strlenAccumulate
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5       BDT_findNode
===============================================================

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

NodeDtGood.c
- Node_new module bloat
      - Has way too many invariants called.
      - it should have a static function that calls invariants. 
Path, Dynarray
- Funtion names + Static function length 
      Path
      - The names are unclear about what they do. And helper 
      functions should have names that make them clear they are
      helper functions. For example Path_split does not clearly
      say what exactly it is splitting, or into what.
      - Some functions are too long and need more static helpers.
      Such as Path_split aswell. Especially as a helper function this
      code should not be taking up this much space with 
      invariants.
The same themese occur in DynArray
      - **DynArray_bsearchHelp does not say what it actually does
            however it does clarify that it is a helper function which 
            is good. However it's only difference from another function
            within DynArray's API is that it says "help"
       - Dynarray.c actually has pretty good modularity, and
            is not too bloated.


Parameter Ordering
      int Path_dup(Path_T oPPath, Path_T *poPResult);
      - This should maybe use the system that is generally used such 
as in strcpy where the dst memory is first, and the memory copying
is second. This is a theme with other functions such as Path_New.
